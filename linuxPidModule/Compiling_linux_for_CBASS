make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/embedded modules/
uImage

[This creates the linux image used by U-Boot]

This should be copied into the appropriate place in the windows SAMBA directory as uImage_write. Copy NADNFLASH.tcl to /lib/AT91SAM9260ek/

Run AT91SAM9260_demo_linux_Nandflash.bat (edit to correct device)

If the AT91SAM9260 is then restored to the factory setting, it will load the appropriate linux image (uImage_write) into the correct memory space of the AT91SAM9260. This is the most foolproof and safest way of achieving this.

make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/embedded modules

[This does the cross compiling for the 2.6.26 kernel]
